# Diabetes

Our focus for this repository is to analyze the diabetes dataset using machine learning algorithms. This dataset, sourced from Python's scikit-learn package (specifically from sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes), offers valuable information for our analysis. By exploring this important dataset, our primary objective is to learn various machine learning algorithms and identify the most effective one for predicting diabetes progression.

In our analysis, we employ several machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet, k-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor. Each of these methods provides unique insights and performance metrics, allowing us to compare and contrast their effectiveness in predicting diabetes outcomes. Through this comparative approach, we aim to determine which algorithm performs best, thereby enhancing our understanding of machine learning techniques and their applications in medical data analysis.
